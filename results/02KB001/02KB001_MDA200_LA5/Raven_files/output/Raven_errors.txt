WARNING : ParseInputFile: :Precipitation command only accepts a 'to' compartment type of MULTIPLE. The user-specified compartment will be overridden.
ADVISORY : CDiagPeriod: :EvaluationPeriod TESTING: the evaluation period is only partially covered by the simulation period. Diagnostics will not indicate performance over entire evaluation period specified.
ADVISORY : The required global parameter RAINSNOW_TEMP was autogenerated with value 0.150000
ADVISORY : The required parameter POROSITY for soil class AQUIFER was autogenerated with value 1.000000
WARNING : HRU groups should ideally be defined in .rvi file (using :DefineHRUGroup(s) commands) before being populated in .rvh file (2)
WARNING : CGauge::AddTimeSeries: a time series of data has been overwritten at gauge 02KB001
WARNING : CChannelXSect::CheckReferenceFlow: reference flow exceeds channel maximum flow in subbasin 3050528. Need to specify larger range of stages in channel profile.
ADVISORY : CModel::InitializeBasins: one or more subbasin reference discharges were autogenerated from annual average runoff
SIMULATION COMPLETE :)
